(**
   Parsing of player commands.
*)

(** The type [object_phrase] represents the object phrase that can be part of a 
    player command.  Each element of the list represents a word of the object 
    phrase, where a {i word} is defined as a consecutive sequence of non-space 
    characters.  Thus, no element of the list should contain any leading,
    internal, or trailing spaces.  The list is in the same order as the words 
    in the original player command. *)
type object_phrase = string list

(** The type [command] represents a player command that is decomposed
    into a verb and possibly an object phrase. *)
type command = 
  | Draw of object_phrase
  | Discard of object_phrase
  | Knock
  | Pass
  | Sort

(** [parse str] parses a player's input into a [command].

    Requires: [str] contains only alphanumeric (A-Z, a-z, 0-9) and space 
    characters (only ASCII character code 32; not tabs or newlines, etc.).

    Raises: [Empty] if [str] is the empty string or contains only spaces. 

    Raises: [Malformed] if the command is malformed. *)
