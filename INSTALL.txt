EXPLANATION:

Gin Rummy is a turn-based card game that is typically played between two 
players. To start, each player is dealt ten cards from a shuffled standard 
52-card deck. The 21st card from the deck is placed face up in the center of 
the table to start the discard pile, and the rest of the deck is placed face 
down next to it. During a normal turn, each player is allowed to first draw a 
card from either the stock or the discard pile and then discard a card of their 
choosing from their hand. The object of the game is to collect a hand where most 
or all of the cards can be combined into sets and runs (see Terminology for 
definitions) and the point value of the remaining unmatched cards is low. 
Number cards have point values equivalent to their rank, while Aces have point 
values of one and Jack, Queen, and King cards have point values of ten. Players 
take turns making moves until someone knocks following a draw on their turn. 
After knocking, the round is over and each player’s score is totaled. A new 
round begins with a new deck and new hands. A player has won when they 
accumulate a score of over 100.

In our version of Gin Rummy, players enter commands in the terminal to make 
certain moves. When the game starts, it will prompt for both players’ names, 
and then the first player’s turn will start. After Player 1 has run their 
commands and has finished their turn, the game will naturally switch over the 
second player’s turn. These turns are indicated by whose hand is currently 
being shown. The game includes unique terminology that we’ve defined below.

TERMINOLOGY:

Meld: Either a set or a run. A card can only belong to one set or rank at a time.

Set: Three or more cards of the same rank. 

Run: Three or more cards of the same suit in consecutive order. In Gin Rummy, 
     the Ace is low, so A-2-3 is a valid run, but Q-K-A is not.

Deadwood: The set of cards in a player’s hand that do not form melds.

Additionally Gin Rummy involves a series of different commands. The commands 
that players can use in the terminal and the restrictions for these commands 
are listed below:

COMMANDS:

Draw: Draw is used to draw a new card from either the stock pile or discard 
pile. If the draw command was successful this command will show the drawn card 
in the current player’s hand and it will be taken away from whatever pile the 
card was called from. Drawing from the discard pile will add the top card of 
the discard pile, which is faced up, to your hand. Drawing from the stock pile 
will add the top card of the shuffled stock deck, which is faced down, to your 
hand. To draw a card, you must type “draw”, a space, and then the name of the 
pile you wish to draw from. 
    Ex. “Draw stock”, “draw Stock”, “draw discard”, and “Draw Discard” are all 
        valid commands. 
The rules for when you can draw are listed below:
    You cannot draw from the stock pile during your first turn
    You can only draw once per turn
    You cannot draw when the stock pile has fewer than 2 cards; 
      this leads to a null game and the round is reset

Discard: Discard is used to discard a card from your hand. To discard a card, 
you must type “discard”, a space and then the name of the card you wish to 
discard. 
    Ex. “Discard ace of spades”, “discard King Of Hearts”, and 
        “discard king of hearts” are all valid commands. 
Additionally the card that you are discarding must be a card in your hand. 
If the card is not present in your hand, it is not a valid command.
The rules for when you can discard are listed below:
    You can only discard a card after you have drawn a card during this turn
    If you just drew a card from the discard pile, you cannot discard that card
    You can only discard once per turn

Pass: Pass is used to skip your turn in the beginning of the game, when the only 
other option is to draw the face-up card in the discard pile. After the first 
player passes, the second player can also either pass or draw the card in the 
discard pile. Following this, a normal turn begins. To pass, you must type “pass”. 
    Ex. “pass” and “Pass” are valid commands. 
The rules for when you can pass are listed below:
    If you are the first player, you can only pass if it is your first turn of 
      the beginning of a round
    If you are the second player, you can only pass if it is your first turn of 
      the beginning of a round and the first player also passed

Score: Score is used to get your current score. When this command is used, the 
current player’s score will be shown in the terminal. Each player’s score is 
only recalculated at the end of each round. To get your score, you must 
type “score”. 
Ex. “score” and “Score” are valid commands. 
You can always use the score command.

Sort: Sort is used to sort your current hand. To sort, you must type “sort”. 
Ex. “sort” and “Sort” are valid commands. 
You can always use the sort command.

Help: Help brings up the help menu, with instructions on how to play the game. 
If you need help playing, type “help”. 
Ex. “help” and “Help” are valid commands. 
You can always use the help command.

Hint: Hint suggests the strategic next move for you. To receive a hint, 
you must type “hint”. 
Ex. “hint” and “Hint” are valid commands. 
You can always use the hint command.

Quit: Quit is used to terminate the game. To quit, you must type “quit”. 
Ex. “quit” and “Quit” are valid commands. 
You can always use the quit command.

Knock: Knock is used to end the current round when a player believes the value 
of their deadwood is less than that of their opponent’s. When a player knocks, 
the opposing player will be prompted to lay off their deadwood (see match below). 
After the opposing player matches, the current scores will be calculated based 
on the value of deadwood each player has remaining. The game will determine who 
won the round and a new round will begin. The winner and the scores will be 
outputted in the terminal. To knock, you must type “knock”. 
    Ex. “knock” and “Knock” are valid commands. 
The rules for when you can knock are listed below:
    You can only knock after you have drawn a card during this turn
    You can only knock if the value of your deadwood will be less than 10 at the
    end of your turn
      (After drawing a card, your hand will have eleven cards, so the deadwood 
      card with the highest value is assumed to be automatically discarded 
      during a knock. Therefore, this card will not factor into the value of 
      your deadwood)

Gin: Going gin is knocking when you have no deadwood after discarding. This 
means that you either have no deadwood upon knocking or will have no deadwood
factoring in the automatic discard after knocking. When you go gin, your 
opponent will not have the opportunity to lay off their cards and you 
automatically win that round. To go gin, you must type “gin”. 
    Ex. “gin” and “Gin” are valid commands. 
The rules for when you can go gin are listed below:
    You can only go gin after you have drawn a card during this turn
    You can only knock if the value of your deadwood will be 0 at the
    end of your turn
      (After drawing a card, your hand will have eleven cards, so the deadwood 
      card with the highest value is assumed to be automatically discarded 
      during a knock. Therefore, this card will not factor into the value of 
      your deadwood)

Match: Match is used following your opponent’s knock if your opponent does not 
go gin. This involves laying off any unmatched cards in your hand to extend the 
runs and sets laid down by your opponent. To lay off your cards, you must 
type “match”. 
    Ex. “match” and “Match” are valid commands. 
The terminal will then prompt for a list of cards to lay off. 
The cards that you wish to lay off must be a part of your deadwood. 
    Ex. “ace of hearts,two of diamonds” is a valid lay off list if an 
    Ace of Hearts and a Two of Diamonds can be added to the melds of 
    your opponent. 
The rules for when you can match are listed below:
    You can only match directly after your opponent has knocked
    You cannot match if your opponent has gone gin
